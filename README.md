# Triple Triad League of Legends Edition

Based on the Final Fantasy VIII card game Triple Triad.

All game concepts are based on work by Square Enix, and music is the property of Square Enix.

Characters and graphics are based on work from Riot Games and are the property of Riot Games.

## Motivation
Roderick Cardenas (contributor) and myself both loved playing the in game card game that was Triple Triad in the amazing Final Fantasy VIII.

To explore what it was like to build a game and to further our knowlegde and skills of JavaScript we decided to relive our childhood and create our own version styled and themed using Rod's love of League of Legends.
